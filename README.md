# PriceTrackerBot
A simple bot that tracks a list of items on amazon.com. When one of the items is below the desired price, it sends an email to a given google email address.

## Prequisite
* bs4
* json
* smtplib
* requests
* time
* A Gmail account

## Setup
* Modify "config.json" file with your credentials. 
* Headers can be obtained by searching them in a search engine.
* Use [two factors authentification](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/). This will allow you to use a [dedicated password generated by google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en-GB&ctx=ch_DisplayUnlockCaptcha).
* Add items to the track list in "items_list.json"

Note: Amazon websites don't work the same way. You have to check what `requests`  returns.

## Usage
The bot can run in background and can be daemonised while occupying minimum ram usage (38 MB on Win10). It can run for a number of days or indefinitly (if so, you will have kill it manually).
